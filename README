JMatrix is a dense matrix library which allows manual placement of results
and intermediate computations in order to avoid garbage collection.

Supported matrix decompositions:

  LU decomposition
  QR decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  SVD: singular value decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  Cholesky decomposition (both LL and LDL forms)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

  Make sure you have a java compiler installed, preferrably 1.8 or higher.
  To test this, issue: javac -version

  To run the tests and the benchmarks, install junit4.
  The junit4.jar file should be located in the directory specified in
  the java-libs proeprty of the build.xml file (by default: /usr/share/java).
  
  These requirements can be simply met on an Ubuntu system by:
  
    sudo apt install default-jdk junit4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE:

Compilation:

  ant compile
  ant jar

Generating documentation:

  ant doc

Running tests:

  Running all test cases:

    ant test

  Running a single test case (e.g., basicReducedSVD in MatrixTests):

    ant test-single -Dtestcase=MatrixTests#basicReducedSVD

Running benchmarks:

  Running all benchmarks with a randomly generated seed:

    ant bench

  Specifying the random seed (e.g., 17192331):

    ant bench -Dseed=17192331

  Specifying the benchmarks (e.g., running the LU, QR, and SVD benchmarks):

    ant bench -Dbenchmarks=LU,QR,SVD

  For all the available benchmarks, see BENCHMARKS in BenchmarkRunner.

Cleaning:

  ant clean
