JMatrix is a dense matrix library which allows manual placement of results
and intermediate computations in order to avoid garbage collection.

Supported matrix decompositions:

  LU decomposition
  QR decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  SVD: singular value decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  Cholesky decomposition (both LL and LDL forms)

INSTALLATION:

  Make sure you have a java compiler installed, preferrably 1.8 or higher.
  To test this, issue: javac -version

  To run the tests and the benchmarks, install junit4.
  The junit4.jar file should be located in the directory specified in
  the java-libs proeprty of the build.xml file (by default: /usr/share/java).
  
  These requirements can be simply met on an Ubuntu system by:
  
    sudo apt install default-jdk junit4
