JMatrix is a dense matrix library which allows user caching of the results
and the intermediate computations to avoid garbage collection.

This is a work in progress, expect minor API changes...

Supported matrix decompositions:

  LU decomposition
  QR decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  SVD: singular value decomposition (both full and reduced forms)
  Cholesky decomposition (both LL and LDL forms)
