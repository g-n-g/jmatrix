Refactoring:

Workflow warning in README.
Allow result = null settings everywhere.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality:

Reduced QR decomposition (reducedQR).
Full SVD.

spectral norm computation
  - power method

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance:

Blocked versions of matrix multiplication and some decompositions.
Initial reducedQR to improve reducedSVD performance.

Benchmarking against other matrix libraries.
