Refactoring:

Comment refactor: result storage of the returned value (or <code>null</code>)
Extending back substitution to non-square triangular matrices.
Least squares examples and benchmarks.
Show total runtime for running benchmarks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality:

eigenvalue and eigenvector computations
zero pivot replacement for Cholesky decomposition
column pivoting for QR decomposition

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance:

Check QR decomposition by Givens rotations.
Try to optimize Q matrix computation for QR decomposition.

Representation inside Matrix class
with support for zero, identity and diagonal matrices.

Single array matrix representation with iterators.
Interface refactoring with workspace objects per thread.
