Refactoring:

Separate matrix statistics for each benchmark type (not just A matrix stat).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality:

general least squares solution (solve)
eigenvalue and eigenvector computations
zero pivot replacement for Cholesky decomposition
column pivoting for QR decomposition
LU, LL, QR, SVD decomposition updating

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance:

Check using reducedQR for the first step of SVD.
Check QR decomposition by Givens rotations.
Try to optimize Q matrix computation for QR decomposition.

Representation inside Matrix class
with support for zero, identity and diagonal matrices.

Single array matrix representation with iterators.
Interface refactoring with workspace objects per thread.
